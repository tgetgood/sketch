# Sketch

Experiment in graphical programming for non programmers (as well as
programmers).

## Overview

See sketch.org for details.

## Status

This project shares a lot with [Infograph](github.com/tgetgood/infograph),
though they differ in how they work for the user.

I've decided to put this guy on hold in favour of infograph since it shows more
promise and has a clearer --- if no less ambitious --- vision.
