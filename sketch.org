#+TITLE: A Modern Take on Sketchpad
#+STARTUP:nologdone

This isn't really about Sketchpad. I'm just taking the scope of what Sutherland
did as inspiration.

The goal is a duality between the input modes of code and sketching on
canvas. The idea being that if you can see the code your sketch produces, you'll
have an enourmously easier time animating it.
